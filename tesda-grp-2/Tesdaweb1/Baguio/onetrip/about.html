                        <h2>It's rich history</h2>
                        <p class = "text">Baguio, often referred to as the "Summer Capital of the Philippines," has a rich history dating back to its indigenous roots. It was originally inhabited by the Ibalois and other indigenous peoples who called the area "Kafagway." The arrival of the Spanish in the late 19th century led to its gradual development as a hill station for American colonial officials, where they could escape the heat of the lowlands.</p>
                        <p class = "text">The city's history took a significant turn when it was established as a hill station by the Americans in 1900, during the colonial period. Baguio was designed by American architect Daniel Burnham, whose plan included wide streets, parks, and a distinctive radial pattern. The city became the official summer residence of the Philippine Commission and subsequently a popular retreat for both American and Filipino dignitaries.</p>
                        <p class = "text">Baguio continued to grow, and during World War II, it was severely affected by the conflict, with many of its buildings and infrastructure damaged. After the war, it was rebuilt and expanded as a thriving city.</p>
                        <p class = "text">In 1990, Baguio faced another significant challenge when a devastating earthquake struck, causing extensive damage. The city was once again rebuilt, and since then, it has continued to evolve as a major urban center and a popular tourist destination, known for its cool climate, scenic landscapes, and rich cultural heritage.</p>
